React Router and Reusable Component Structure

## About The Project

* In this project, I wanted to work on routing in React applications. <br />
  I also realized the importance of avoiding code duplication by creating reusable components. <br />
  Screenshot 1 displays the cars in the "cars" array. When I click on any car, a page similar to the other screenshots is displayed. <br />
  Also look at the urls. The URL changes dynamically. This is one of the nice features of React Router.
